## About

**CompoundED** is an interactive, gamified platform to learn decentralized finance (DeFi) concepts—lending, borrowing, APY, and more—completely risk-free.  
It simulates a real DeFi dashboard (like Compound), but uses mock data and wallets so anyone can practice, learn, and build financial literacy without spending real money or needing a crypto wallet.

CompoundED supports both **English and Hindi** (with instant language switching) and lets users choose their favorite color scheme for an engaging, personalized experience.

## Features

- **Interactive DeFi Dashboard:**  
  Simulate lending, borrowing, and earning interest with live APY (demo) and risk gauge.
- **Gamified Learning:**  
  Earn badges, complete daily/weekly challenges, and climb the leaderboard.
- **Dynamic Quizzes & Glossary:**  
  Test your knowledge with shuffled quizzes and get instant explanations; explore an interactive glossary.
- **Mock Wallet Connect:**  
  Experience DeFi realistically—no real wallet or funds required.
- **Personalized Learning Paths:**  
  Dashboard suggests next steps based on your progress.
- **Accessibility & Multilingual:**  
  Switch between English and Hindi. Choose from multiple color themes.
- **Beautiful, Modern UI:**  
  Glassmorphism, gradients, Lottie animations, and responsive design.
- **Educator Support:**  
  Downloadable teacher/club kits and classroom resources.
- **Open Source & Safe:**  
  All code is open source and simulations are risk-free.
